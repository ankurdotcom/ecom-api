To create a robust e-commerce API POC aligned with the requirements, hereâ€™s a detailed plan:

### 1. **Architecture Design**
   - **Microservices:** Each core functionality (e.g., Catalog, Orders, Payment, Notifications) will be a separate service.
   - **Cloud-Native Principles:** Utilize containerized services orchestrated by Kubernetes (GKE) for deployment.
   - **APIs:** RESTful APIs with OpenAPI Specification for contract-driven development.
   - **Communication:** Use a combination of synchronous (HTTP/REST) and asynchronous (Pub/Sub, gRPC) communication.
   - **Database:** Polyglot persistence:
     - Relational DB (Cloud SQL) for Orders and Payment.
     - NoSQL (Firestore) for Catalog.
     - Cache (Memorystore/Redis) for fast reads.
   - **Event-Driven Architecture:** Employ Pub/Sub for event handling like order placement or inventory updates.
   - **Distributed Transactions:** Use Saga Pattern with a choreography-based approach to manage transactions across services.

### 2. **Google Cloud Infrastructure**
   - **Compute:** GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) for deploying containerized services.
   - **Networking:** Configure a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Load Balancer for API Gateway.
   - **Storage:** Cloud Storage for assets (e.g., product images).
   - **Security:** IAM roles for least privilege access, service-to-service authentication using Google IAM or JWT.
   - **Monitoring & Logging:** Stackdriver for centralized monitoring and logging.

### 3. **Key Functional Components**
   - **Catalog Service:** Manages product information. Supports search and filter.
   - **Order Service:** Handles order creation, status, and history.
   - **Payment Service:** Manages payment workflows and retries.
   - **Notification Service:** Sends email/SMS notifications.
   - **Authentication:** Use Google Identity Platform for OAuth2.0-based user authentication.

### 4. **Failure Scenarios**
   - **Database Failures:** Automatic retries and fallback using circuit breakers (Resilience4j or Hystrix).
   - **Service Unavailability:** Load balancing and horizontal scaling, backed by auto-scaling.
   - **Partial Failures in Transactions:** Use compensating transactions to roll back in Saga pattern.

### 5. **Best Practices**
   - Follow 12-factor app principles.
   - Use CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and deployments.
   - Implement observability with tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry).
   - Define clear API rate limits and quotas.
   - Ensure APIs are backward-compatible.

### 6. **Implementation Roadmap**
   - **Week 1:** Define architecture and set up the infrastructure (GKE, VPC, IAM, etc.).
   - **Week 2:** Develop core services (Catalog, Orders, Payment).
   - **Week 3:** Add distributed transaction handling, integrate event bus (Pub/Sub), and implement notifications.
   - **Week 4:** Add observability, stress testing, and edge-case simulations.
